# tipi.build HermeticFetchContent

Usable with either `cmake` or `cmake-re` this CMake module provides an 
integration of  Third-party libraries into the project's CMake build system 
giving better control (in regard to especially toolchain matter).

## Usage

1) Add `include(HermeticFetchContent)` to the CMakelists
2) Learn more in the [documentation](./public/documentation/index.html)

The different dependencies are made available to the project's targets as 
libraries and executables that can be "target linked" or "found" as one would 
normally expect in a modern CMake build system.

### Hermeticity

When used with `cmake` the dependency builds are placed as content builds in 
isolated source / build / install trees in a folder structure under
`<build-prefix>/_deps/<content-name>-<src|build|install|...>`.
 
The hermeticity extends to the level that the dependency builds are not aware
of each other *unless* they are made `find_package`-able explicitely using 
the options in the `FetchContent_MakeHermetic()` declaration for each
respective dependency.

### Build Graph reorganization

Depending on the selection of either being made available at build time or 
configure time by using:

  * `HermeticFetchContent_MakeAvailableAtBuildTime(<content-name>)`
  * `HermeticFetchContent_MakeAvailableAtConfigureTime(<content-name>)`

The dependency will be either just configured or build and configured during the
project's configure phase. The former case guarentees best performance when 
running the builds because dependencies can be built as needed (as they are 
fully integrated in the build graph).

### Cacheability

Relying targets scanning technique to enable depending only on FetchContent 
install/ trees, when used with `cmake-re` the builds of the dependencies are
executed in a manner that enables them to be cached independently of the project
to improve cache hits and library build reeuses on the L1 cache (by using
 `cmake-re`'s mirroring and caching technology).

This feature allows to save time needlessly spent on CI runs checking out code
of thirdparties instead of building changes.

### SBOM

Hermetic FetchContent provides an out of the box integration with 
[cmake-SBOM by DEMCON](https://github.com/DEMCON/cmake-sbom.git) (which can be 
either auto-bootstrapped or provided by your project - if `include(sbom)` works
the provided version is used)

The feature is enabled by default but can be disabled by setting the option
`HFC_ENABLE_CMAKE_SBOM` to `OFF`

To add information about licences and author to the metadata you can:

```cmake
FetchContent_MakeHermetic(
  <content_name>
  [...snip...]
  SBOM_LICENSE "MIT License"
  SBOM_SUPPLIER "Mr. Wonderful"
)
```

Here's how to trigger the actual SBOM generation (should be placed after all dependencies were registered)

```cmake
include(hfc_sbom)
hfc_generate_sbom(
  OUTPUT "my-awesome-sbom.spdx"
  LICENSE "Proprietary"
  SUPPLIER "You"
  SUPPLIER_URL "your-url.com"
  NO_VERIFY
)
```

## Developer Guide

You can run the HermeticFetchContent test suite this way:

  * `cmake -S . -B build/ -DCMAKE_TOOLCHAIN_FILE=toolchain/toolchain.cmake -GNinja` **[*]** 
  * `cmake --build build/`
  * `ctest -R check_options_and_defines_forwarding`


**[*]** Additionally the following variable can be defined to ease development:

  * `export HFC_TEST_SHARED_TOOLS_DIR=$PWD/thirdparty/cache/.hfc_tools`

  * `HFC_PROJECT_HFC_SOURCE_CACHEDIR` to use a common source cache for the builds of the test project 
  * `HFC_PROJECT_HFC_BASEDIR` to use a common "HFC base dir" (which will contain the dependency install trees)
  * `HERMETIC_FETCHCONTENT_TOOLS_DIR` if you have one, avoid rebuilding `goldilock` too frequently, by default a `${CMAKE_BINARY_DIR}/.hfc_tools/` directory will be created
